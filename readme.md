# **Auto Wifi Login**
Tired of entering the same Wi-Fi credentials every time you join the network? So was I! ðŸ˜… In my institute, there was no way to automate Wi-Fi login, and I found myself typing the same password repeatedly. That's when I decided to create this Auto Wifi Login Script!

This open-source script automates the process of logging into Wi-Fi networks using pre-saved credentials. Whether you're stuck in a loop of constant re-logins at your school, work, or any place that requires repetitive Wi-Fi access, this script has got you covered! ðŸŽ‰

Feel free to customize it for your own institution, workplace, or any location where you need to log in to the same Wi-Fi every time. Say goodbye to repetitive typing and hello to effortless connectivity!

The Auto Wifi Login Script is an open-source solution designed to automate the process of connecting to Wi-Fi networks. By leveraging saved credentials, this script eliminates the need for manual Wi-Fi logins, making it ideal for users who frequently connect to multiple networks or in environments with recurring Wi-Fi setups. The script works across various operating systems, and it can be easily customized to meet different network configurations.

Whether you're setting up a new device or simply want to automate Wi-Fi connectivity, this script can save time and effort, while ensuring seamless access to the internet.

To set up the Auto Wifi Login Script project, one should have the following prerequisites and basic knowledge:

1. Basic Knowledge of Command Line / Terminal.
2. Understanding of Scripting Language (Bash/shell scrpting and python basics)
3. Working Knowledge of Wi-Fi Networking(GET,POST requests)
4. Basic Knowledge of Scheduling Tasks (Cron Jobs)


# **Setting Up the Project Locally**

#### 1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RGIPT_Auto_Connect.git
   ```

#### 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Move into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RGIPT_Auto_Connect
   ```

#### 3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   The script may require certain environment variables (like Wi-Fi credentials). You can either add these to a `.env` file or set them directly in your terminal.

   Example:
   ```bash
   export WIFI_SSID="Your_Wifi_SSID"
   export WIFI_PASSWORD="Your_Wifi_Password"
   ```

   If you're using a `.env` file, make sure you load it by adding the following to your script or use `python-dotenv` if itâ€™s a Python-based script:
   ```bash
   pip3 install python-dotenv
   ```

   Add this line to your Python script:
   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file
   ```

   Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   WIFI_SSID=Your_Wifi_SSID
   WIFI_PASSWORD=Your_Wifi_Password
   ```

#### 4. **Make the Script Executable (For Bash or Shell Scripts):**
   If you are using a shell script like `auto_wifi_login.sh`, make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x auto_wifi_login.sh
   ```

   For Python scripts (e.g., `wifi_auto_login.py`), ensure you have the correct Python environment set up and use `python3` to run it.

#### 5. **Running the Script:**
   Run the script to automatically log into the Wi-Fi network.

   For a Bash script (`auto_wifi_login.sh`):
   ```bash
   ./auto_wifi_login.sh
   ```

   For a Python script (`wifi_auto_login.py`):
   ```bash
   python3 wifi_auto_login.py
   ```

#### 6. **Schedule the Script to Run Automatically :**
   To make the script run periodically, you can schedule it with **cron** (Linux/Mac). For example, to run the script every 5 minutes:

   1. Open the crontab editor:
      ```bash
      crontab -e
      ```

   2. Add a cron job entry to run the script every 5 minutes (modify path and script name as necessary):
      ```bash
      */5 * * * * /path/to/your/script/auto_wifi_login.sh
      ```
   
      Or for a Python script:
      ```bash
      */5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script/wifi_auto_login.py
      ```

   3. Save and exit the editor.

   This will automatically attempt to connect to the Wi-Fi every 5 minutes.
