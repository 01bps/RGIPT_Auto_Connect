# **Auto Wifi Login**
Tired of entering the same Wi-Fi credentials every time you join the network? So was I! 😅 In my institute, there was no way to automate Wi-Fi login, and I found myself typing the same password repeatedly. That's when I decided to create this Auto Wifi Login Script!

This script automates the process of logging into Wi-Fi networks using pre-saved credentials. Whether you're stuck in a loop of constant re-logins at your school, work, or any place that requires repetitive Wi-Fi access, this script has got you covered! 🎉

Feel free to customize it for your own institution, workplace, or any location where you need to log in to the same Wi-Fi every time. Say goodbye to repetitive typing and hello to effortless connectivity!

The Auto Wifi Login Script is an open-source solution designed to automate the process of connecting to Wi-Fi networks. By leveraging saved credentials, this script eliminates the need for manual Wi-Fi logins, making it ideal for users who frequently connect to multiple networks or in environments with recurring Wi-Fi setups. The script works across various operating systems, and it can be easily customized to meet different network configurations.

Whether you're setting up a new device or simply want to automate Wi-Fi connectivity, this script can save time and effort, while ensuring seamless access to the internet.
