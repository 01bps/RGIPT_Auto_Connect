# **Auto Wifi Login**
"Tired of entering the same Wi-Fi credentials every time you join the network? So was I! ðŸ˜… At my institute, logging into Wi-Fi manually was a hassle, so I built this Auto WiFi Login Script to automate the process!

This script automatically logs into Wi-Fi networks using pre-saved credentials and now comes with SQLite integration to store login attempts. It keeps track of all login activities, captures dynamic session parameters (a), and provides a user-friendly log display for debugging.

Ideal for schools, workplaces, or any location with recurring Wi-Fi logins, this script eliminates manual re-authentication and ensures effortless connectivity. It's fully customizable, works across different networks, and can even be automated on startup for a seamless experience.

Say goodbye to typing passwords repeatedly and hello to smart, automated Wi-Fi access!"


## **Features**

-  Secure credential storage using SQLite database
