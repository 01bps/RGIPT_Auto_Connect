## Project Workflow: Step-by-Step Demonstration of WiFi Auto Login Project

This section provides a detailed walkthrough of how the WiFi Auto Login script functions, from inspecting the login process to executing the script and storing login attempts in SQLite. Each step is supported by screenshots to help visualize the process.

The demonstration covers:
- Identifying the correct POST URL and payload parameters using browser dev tools.
- Setting up the Python script in a chosen directory.
- Running the script to automate login.
- Storing login attempts securely in an SQLite database, including response details.
